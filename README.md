# Angular Reactive Forms

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the features, flexibility, and testability of [Angular's reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms)

- Separates data architecture from visual architecture 
- [Observable input changes](https://angular.io/api/forms/AbstractControl#valueChanges)
- [Nested form groups](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms#nesting-form-groups)
- [Form arrays](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms#nesting-form-groups)
- [Validations](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms#nesting-form-groups)
- Testability

The repo contains two examples: a very basic example under `auth-form` and a more complex example under `reactive-form`.
